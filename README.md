# Analyzing-Car-Accidents-Project
Project Overview
This project analyzes car accident data from various cities across the United States. The goal is to uncover patterns and trends in car accidents to better understand the factors that contribute to these incidents. By examining variables such as location, time of day, weather conditions, road types, and the presence of traffic calming measures, we can identify areas for improvement in road safety.
